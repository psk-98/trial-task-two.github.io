Interactivity: Craft a set of at least three interactive UI elements 
(e.g., buttons, sliders, toggles) that each utilize a different 
CSS transition or transform when interacted with.

Pseudo-Elements: Design a section where ::before and ::after 
pseudo-elements play a crucial role. This can be decorative, functional, 
or both.

3D Elements: Implement a component that uses CSS 3D transforms. This 
could be a card flip, a rotating cube, or any 3D interaction of your 
choice.


Custom Cursors: Create at least one custom cursor that changes based on 
the area of the webpage it's over.


Visual Feedback: Ensure that interactive elements provide clear 
visual feedback using CSS techniques.
